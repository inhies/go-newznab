newznab
=======

This is a Go package for working with Newznab APIs. It is still under heavy
development so don't rely on it just yet. A breaking change is probably just
around the corner!

As of February 2015 this package's interface has stabilized and should be safe
to use. Some features are still missing and tests need to be written but for the
most part it works.

I welcome pull requests!
